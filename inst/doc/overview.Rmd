# ggExtra

`ggExtra` is a collection of functions and layers to enhance ggplot2.

Most functions/layers are quite simple but are useful because they are fairly 
common ggplot2 operations that are a bit verbose. After repeating the same
small bits of ggplot2 code dozens of times, I realized it was time to package
them :)

The `ggMarginal` function is more complex. After intensive Googling for ways
to add marginal density plots to ggplot2, I did find a few lengthy StackOverflow
posts, but every answer had messy code that was specific for the dataset in
question. I wasn't able to find a simple drop-in function for adding marginal
densities, so I created one.

Other functions include: `removeGrid` (and two variants), `rotateTextX`,
`plotCount`.

*Note: you might notice that there are no unit tests in this package. I don't
know of a good way to perform tests on plots, if you have a nice simple
solution please do let me know.*

## Installation

`ggExtra` is currently only available through GitHub and can be downloaded
easily using `devtools`.

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("daattali/ggExtra")
```

## Usage

We'll first load the package and ggplot2, and then see how all the functions work.

```{r load-pkg}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library("ggExtra")
  library("ggplot2")
})
```

## `ggMarginal` - Add marginal density/histogram to ggplot2 scatterplots

You need to have the `grid` and `gridExtra` packages installed for this
function.  

This function is meant to work as an easy drop-in solution for adding marginal
density plots of histograms to a ggplot2 scatterplot. You can either pass it
a ready ggplot2 scatterplot and it will add the marginal plots, or you can just
tell it what dataset and variables to use and it will generate the scatterplot
plus the marginal plots.

As a simple first example, let's create a dataset with 500 points where the
x values are normally distributed and the y values are uniformly distributed,
and plot a simple ggplot2 scatterplot.

```{r init-plot}
set.seed(30)
df1 <- data.frame(x = rnorm(500, 50, 10), y = runif(500, 0, 50))
(p1 <- ggplot(df1, aes(x, y)) + geom_point() + theme_bw())
```

Ok, now let's add marginal density plots.

```{r ggmarginal-basic}
ggMarginal(p1)
```

That was easy. Notice how the syntax is not following the standard ggplot2
syntax - you don't "add" a ggMarginal layer with `p1 + ggMarginal()`, but rather
ggMarginal takes the object as an argument and returns a different object
`ggMarginal(p1)`. This means that you can use magrittr pipes, for example
`p1 %>% ggMarginal`.

Let's make the text a bit larger to make it easier to see.

```{r ggmarginal-large}
ggMarginal(p1 + theme_bw(30) + ylab("Two\nlines"))
```

Notice how the marginal plots occupy the correct space, and even when the main
plot's points are pushed to the right because of larger text or longer axis labels,
the marginal plots automatically adjust.

You can also show histograms instead.

```{r ggmarginal-hist}
ggMarginal(p1, type = "histogram")
```

There are several more parameters, here is an example with a few more being used.

```{r ggmarginal-params}
ggMarginal(p1, margins = "x", size = 2, type = "histogram",
           marginCol = "blue", marginFill = "orange")
```

You don't have to supply a ggplot2 scatterplot, you can also just tell ggMarginal
what dataset and variables to use, but of course this way you lose the ability
to customize the main plot (change text/font/theme/etc).

```{r ggmarginal-manual}
ggMarginal(data = mtcars, x = "wt", y = "mpg")
```

`size = 2` means that the main scatterplot should occupy twice as much height/width
as the margin plots (default is 5).

Last but not least - you can also save the output from `ggMarginal` and display
it later. (I know that sounds trivial, but this was not an easy problem to solve
- [see this discussion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29062766/store-output-from-gridextragrid-arrange-into-an-object)).

```{r ggmarginal-save}
p <- ggMarginal(p1)
p
```

For more information, see `?ggExtra::ggMarginal`.

## `removeGrid` - Remove grid lines from ggplot2

This is just a convenience function to save a bit of typing and memorization.
Minor grid lines are always removed, and the major x or y grid lines can be
removed as well (default is to remove both).

`removeGridX` is a shortcut for `removeGrid(x = TRUE, y = FALSE)`, and
`removeGridY` is similarly a shortcut for... <leave as exercise for reader>.

```{r removeGrid}
df2 <- data.frame(x = 1:50, y = 1:50)
p2 <- ggplot2::ggplot(df2, ggplot2::aes(x, y)) + ggplot2::geom_point()
p2 + removeGrid()
```

For more information, see `?ggExtra::removeGrid`.

## `rotateTextX` - Rotate x axis labels

Often times it is useful to rotate the x axis labels to be vertical if there are
too many labels and they overlap. This function accomplishes that and ensures
the labels are horizontally centered relative to the tick line.

```{r rotateTextX}
df3 <- data.frame(x = paste("Letter", LETTERS, sep = "_"),
                  y = seq_along(LETTERS))
p3 <- ggplot2::ggplot(df3, ggplot2::aes(x, y)) + ggplot2::geom_point()
p3 + rotateTextX()
```

For more information, see `?ggExtra::rotateTextX`.

## `plotCount` - Plot count data with ggplot2

This is a convenience function to quickly plot a bar plot of count (frequency)
data.  The input must be either a frequency table (obtained with `base::table`)
or a data.frame with 2 columns where the first column contains the values and
the second column contains the counts.

An example using a table:
```{r plotCount-table}
plotCount(table(infert$education))
```

An example using a data.frame:
```{r plotCount-df}
df4 <- data.frame("vehicle" = c("bicycle", "car", "unicycle", "Boeing747"),
                  "NumWheels" = c(2, 4, 1, 16))
plotCount(df4) + removeGridX()
```

For more information, see `?ggExtra::plotCount`.
